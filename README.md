# Learning Ladder Website

A local website that allows educational groups to share and explore categorized educational game resources.

Built using PHP, XML, JavaScript, and CSS, the site renders game data dynamically via a custom CMS theme running on an Apache Server. Game content is managed through structured XML files and presented in a consistent, optimized layout.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This website was developed and tested within a university-provided virtual machine (VM). The live site is not publicly accessible, and screenshots are unavailable due to the restricted environment.

- Each game category page includes:
  - A heading based on the category name
  - List of games sorted alphabetically
  - Game description, cost, images, external links, search tags, etc.
